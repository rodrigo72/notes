# 3. Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas

The abbreviation etc. , even if only a single term comes before it, is always preceded by a comma.

# 5. Do not join independent clauses by a comma

If two or more clauses, grammatically complete and not joined by a conjunction, are to form a single compound sentence, the proper mark of ponctuation is a semiclon.

Stevenson's romances are entertaining; they are full of exiting adventures.
It is nearly half past five; we cannot reach town before dark.

# 6. Do not break sentences in two

If the clauses are very short, and are alike in form, a comma is usually permissible: 
Man proposes, God disposes.
The gate swung apart, the bridge fell, the portcullis was drawn up.

# 7. A participal phrase at the beggining of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject

A Participal Phrase At The Beggining Of A Sentence Must Refer To The Grammatical Subject. 
Walking slowly down the road, he saw a woman accompanied by two chilkdren.
The word walking refers to the subject of the sentence, not to the woman. If the writer wishes to make it refer to the woman, he must recast the sentence:
He saw a woman, accompanied by two children, walking slowly down the road.

# 9. Make the paragraph the unit of composition: one paragraph to each topic

Thus a brief description, a brief summary of a literary work, a brief account of a single incident, a narrative merely outlining an action, the setting forth of a single idea, any one of these is best written in a single paragraph.

A novel might be discussed under the heads:
J. Setting
K. Plot
L. Characters
M. Purpose

In dialogue, each speech, even if only a single word, is a paragraph by itself; that is, a new paragraph begins with each change of speaker.

# 10. As a rule, begin each paragraph with a topic sentence; end it in conformity with the beginning

The practice here recommended enables him to discover the purpose of each paragraph as he begins to read it, and to retain purpose in mind as he ends it.
A. the topic sentence comes at or near the beginning;
B. the succeding sentences explain or establish or develop the statement made in the topic sentence; and
C. the final sentence either emphasizes the thought of the topic sentence or states some important consequence

According to the writter's purpose, he may, as indicated above, relate the body of the paragraph to the topic sentence in one or more of several different ways.

# 11. Use the active voice

The active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the passive:
I shall always remember my first visit to Boston.
This is much better than:
My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me.

There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground
Dead leaves covered the ground.

As a rule, avoid making one passive depend directly upon another.
Gold was not allowed to be exported.
It was forbidden to export gold.

# 12. Put statements in positive form

Make definite assertions. Avoid tame, colorless, hesitating, non-commital language. Use the word *not* as a means of denial or in antithesis, never as a means of evasion.
He was not very often on time. > He usually came late.

Consciously or unconsciously, the reader is dissatisfied with being told only what is not; he wishes to be told what is.

The antithesis of negative and positive is strong: 
Not charity, but simple justice.
Not that I loved Caesar less, but Rome the more.

# 13. Omit needles words

Who is, which was, and the like are often superfluos.
His brother, who is a member of the same firm. > His brother, a member of the same firm.

# 14. Avoid a succession of loose sentences

This rule refers especially to loose sentences of a particular type, those consisting of two co-ordinate clauses, the second introduced by a conjuction or relative.

# 15. Express co-ordinate ideas in similar form

An article or a preposition applying to all members of a series must either be used only before the first term or else be repeated before each term.

Correlative expressions (both, and: not, but; not only, but also; either, or; first, second, third; and the like) should be followed by the same grammatical construction. Many violations of this rule can be corrected by rearranging the sentence:
It was both a long ceremony and very tedious. > The ceremony was both long and tedious.

# 16. Keep related words together

The subject of a sentence and the principal verb should not, as a rule, be separated by a phrase or clause tha can be transfered to the beginning.

Wordsworth, in the fifth book of The Excursion, gives a minute description of this church. > In the fifth book of the Excursion, Wordsworth gives a minute description of this church.

THe objection is that the interposed phrase or clause needlessly interrupts the natural order of the main clause.

# 17. In summaries, keep to ine tense

# 18. Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end

The proper place for the word, or group of words, wich the writer desires to make most prominent is usually the end of the sentence.
Humanity has hardly advanced in fortitude sinde that time, though it has advanced in many other ways. > Humanity, since that time, has advanced in many other ways, but it has hardly advanced in fortitude.

Any element in the sentence, other than the subject, becomes emphatic when placed first.
Deciet or treachery he could never forgive.

To recieve special emphasis, the subject of a sentence must take the position of the predicate.
Through the middle of the valley flowed a winding stream.

# A few matters of the form

Numerals. Do not spell out dates or other serial numbers.
Write them in figures or in roman notation, as may be appropriate.

Parentheses. A sentence containing an expression in parenthesis is punctuated, outside of the marks of parenthesis, exactly as if the expression in parenthesis were absent. The expression within is punctuated as if it stood by itself, except that the final stop is omitted unless it is a question mark or an exclamation point.

Quotations. Formal quotations, cited as documentary ecidence, are introduced by a colon and enclosed in quotation marks.

# Words and expressions commonly misused

Consider. Not followed by *as* when it means "believe to be." "I consider him thoroughly competent."

Effect. As noun, means *result*; as verb, means *to bring about, accomplish* (not to be confused with *affect*, which means "to influence").
As noun, often loosly used in perfunctory writing about fashion, music, painting, and other arts: "an Oriental *effect*"

At the end of a list introduced by *such as*, *for example*, or any other similar expression, *etc.* is incorrect.

When however comes first, it means *in whatever way* or *to whatever extent*.
However you advise him, he will probably do as he thinks best. > However discouraging the prospect, he never lost heart.

*Less* refers to quantity, *fewer* to number. "His troubles are less than mine" means "His troubles are not so great as mine."
"His troubles are fewer than mine" means "His troubles are not so numerous as mine."

Often vaguely used in such expressions as "lover of nature;" "poems about nature." Unless more specific statemenst follow, the reader cannot tell wether the poems have to do with natural scenery, rural life, the sunset, the untracked wilderness, or the habits of squirrels.

People. *The people* is a political term, not to be confused with *the public*. From the people comes political support or opposition; from the public comes artistic appreciation or commercial patronage.

Phase. Means a stage of transition or development: "the phases of the moon;" "the last phase." Not to be used for *aspect* or *topic*.
Another phase of the subject > Another point (another question)

So. Avoid, in writing, the use of *so* as an intensifier: "so good;" "so warm;" "so delightful."

In general, the writer will do well to use *while* only with strict literalness, in the sense of *during the time that*.
