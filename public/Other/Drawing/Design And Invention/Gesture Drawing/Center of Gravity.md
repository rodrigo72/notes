After developing your figure's pose as a gesture drawing , you will next give a more concrete description of the major masses: the head, rib cage, and pelvis. Manipulating the figure's center of gravity in an exaggerated manor is essential in creating an interesting pose. On top of the gesture, add a sphere for the head, an egg shape for the rib cage, and a horizontal egg shape for the pelvis.

Creating  a dynamic pose involves creating a sense of tension with the figure's center of gravity. Just as our initial gesture lines create a sense of movement with an imbalance in the placement of line, you should flirt with the idea of imbalance when drawing the shapes of the head, rib cage, and pelvis.

On the left and right, notice how the major masses move around the center of gravity without lining up on it. The last pose is the most dramatic in its distribution of the masses in relation to the center of gravity.
