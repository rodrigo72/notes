The last type of curve used in gesture drawing is wrapping lines. In a quick sketch, wrapping lines are curves that move across and around a form to indicate perspective.

After using wrapping lines, the last step in creating a gesture drawing is to include the shapes of the head, rib cage and pelvis.

When doing this, keep in mind that including these shapes will be a powerful tool in showing proportion, weight, and balance. At this point, keep the shape of the head very simple as a sphere. The rib cage should be shown as a conservative egg-shape that is standing up, while the pelvis is an oval laying on its side.

>[!Tip]
>Try to think of wrapping lines as rubber bands or string tied all the way around a form. The point of this exercise is to never draw a straight line across your drawing. From now on, only use lines that travel around an imagined surface. This will develop a short hand of form/perspective for you and for the viewer.
