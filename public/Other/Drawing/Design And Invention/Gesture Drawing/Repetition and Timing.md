In addition to using asymmetry, the second quality of curve used is that of repetition. Any time a similar curve or shape is repeated twice r more, it provokes a visual movement.

The "C" curves placed next to one another start to push the eye from left to right.

Using asymmetrical curves in addition to repeating curves gives your gesture drawings a solid sense of composition, fluidity, and timing.

In the diagram, notice how repeating curves cause the eye to *slow down* as it moves through the dominant asymmetrical curves. 
Try slowing down the eye (emphasizing repeating lines to produce more side-to-side motion) in more complex areas (areas of intersection: midsection, shoulders, hips, knee, elbow) and speeding it up along the length of forms (such as asymmetrical lines creating a faster push downwards).
