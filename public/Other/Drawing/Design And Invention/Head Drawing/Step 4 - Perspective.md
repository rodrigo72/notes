This step introduces perspective into your drawing. Before this point, everything has been organized through the use of shape to arrange the placement of the larger forms. Perspective is now added to create the illusion of three dimensions.

The first step in deciding on a perspective is to simply **determine whether you are underneath (A) or above (B)** the head. Illustration A shows what a head looks like when seen from underneath. Note that the "t" has changed - it now tilts back across the face. 

To the right, note that this perspective is simplified by the cylinder. When wrapping the "4" across the cranial mass, always draw through and around that sphere as if it were made of glass. The dotted lines on the drawing show how this appears. It is important that this line bisects the sphere at its equatorial center â€” think of this line traveling around the sphere like the line of the equator traverses the surface of the earth.

The two drawings in the center show how to easily place this "t" or eye line. By relating the eye line to the brow and top of the ear, you will more accurately describe the perspective angle.

Illustration B shows the head seen from above. The cylinder to the right of the head shows how all the line work is still geared toward describing a basic perspective idea.
