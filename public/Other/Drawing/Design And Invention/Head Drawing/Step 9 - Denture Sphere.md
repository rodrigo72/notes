This step involves developing the area of the tooth cylinder or denture sphere. This area of bone, which includes the teeth, pushes out and away from the face. This is the main characteristic of the lower portion of the face to develop before drawing the lips.

The denture sphere is an oval. This oval is drawn from the top of the chin up underneath the area of the nose.

# Completed Line Drawing 

This is an example of how your completed line drawing should look. Before moving on to any finishing work on the character or head, make sure there is a fundamental development of the basic forms. These forms are what give your drawings the feeling of **believability, naturalism, and volume**.

Notice that the forms of the face are in a balancing act, alternating between a form projecting out an a form receding in. For example, the forehead pushes out, the eye sockets recede, the nose pushes forward, etc.

# The back of the head

Similar to the profile, the back of the head also offers a unique set of problems. However, you will always begin with the first four major steps. Having set the placement up, the design for the back of the head is one predominately structured on the "T" overlap. The forms you are looking to overlap in this position (the anatomical forms will be discussed in the following chapter) are the Trapezius (1), the form of the neck (2), the sternocleidomastoid (3), the cranial mass (4), and ear (5). Simplify your drawing of the back of the head into an organization of these major forms.
