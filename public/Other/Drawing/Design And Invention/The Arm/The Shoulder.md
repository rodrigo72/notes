The shoulder girdle is a perspectival unit made up of the clavicle (front) and scapula (back). The importance of having a separate form for these bones is to allow them to move independently of the rib cage, as well as adding panar elements. When working with the arms, first pay attention to the development and placement of the shoulder's perspective. Think of this structure as being similar to the shoulder pads worn by football players.

Above is a diagram that gives a process for drawing the arms and legs. This is similar to the anatomy and motion diagram in the previous chapter. This process should look very familiar by now, as it is the same one used for just about everything so far. If you are having difficulty in your drawings, return to this process and double-check your approach. If you notice your drawings are weak in a specific step, focus all your practice time on improving that one area. The challenge in drawing the arms and legs is that all the anatomical shapes are essentially spheres or ellipses, and that they need to be developed on top of a difficult, complex surface (the cylinder).
