The forearm is an incredibly complex weaving of anatomy that will ultimately deserve more time and study than given here. This approach highlights a working process and should under no condition be used as an anatomy reference. I highly recommend that this approach be supplemented with addictional anatomical texts.

When drawing the forearm, the first, most importante step is to determine the location of the radius and ulna during pronation and supination. The ulna remains static, connected to the humerus by a hinge joint, while the radius rotates around the ulna.

Notice that the radius and ulna are similar in shape: both are elongated triangles.

The ulna is wider at the top, as it fits into the humerus, and smaller towards the wrist. The ulna always appears on the pinky-finger side of the wrist.

The radius is opposite in shape of the ulna: a triangle that is flat at the bottom and skinny at the top. The radius always appears on the thumb-side of the wrist.

 The design of the forearm can be reduced into three basic shapes/ ellipses: the flexors, extensors, and ridge muscles. While we will add to these three, these are the major shapes to focus on.

Successful understanding of the forearm's anatomy will help you decipt pronation and supination of the arm.

In pronation, the radius crosses over the ulna. In terms of anatomy, pronation involves the pronator teres, pronator quadratus and flexor carpi radicalis.

In supination, the bones of the radius and ulna lie parallel to one another. Supination is more powerful than pronation. Supination involves the biceps brachii and supinator.

# Process

When working on the arm itself, it is again very important to follow a process. This process will help you organize the most important qualities first, and will aid in invention.

1. To start the arm, it is first most important to position/work out the gesture. On top of the more lyrical, overall gesture, place a straight line to give a strong feeling on the bones as well as 2-D position.

2. Second, build your perspectives on top of the straight. These cylinders are the most important element to provide a believable sense of space and form. The anatomy will need to be wrapped around these sylinders using the two main ideas of transitional volumes.

3. Place the asymmetrical design of the anatomy of the arm on top of the cylinders.
