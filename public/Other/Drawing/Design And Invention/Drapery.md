When drawing drapery, all of the previous principles are used in a way to encourage your working process and hopefully simplify a difficult subject. Again, keep in mind that all the shapes discussed can and will need to be manipulated in order to accommodate the myriad possibilities for different fashions/looks from the scope of history. This process should set you up with a foundation for depicting simple fabrics that move with and wrap around the figure, that can later be expanded upon. 

To begin, there are only a few things that need to be addressed as being completely new to this area of study. First, in most cases, the gesture of drapery is consistent with gravity, and has a descending linear direction. However, this changes in any type of pose where movement or external conditions (for example, wind) are present. Second, different types of drapery (silk, leather, denim, cotton, etc.) have totally unique qualities in the way they respond to movement and form.

In the study of drapery, we will focus on seven different types of folds that will be intimately linked to tension points located on the figure. 

Tension points are the same as landmarks, just renamed to relate them more to the push or grab of fabric. In order to emphasize how these tension points work, try thinking of the skeletal points as being a large, moveable wire hanger. Thinking in this way will make the study of drapery easier, as you will see the seven folds repeatedly occur in the same places. 

Additionally, take note that although we are looking at the seven folds in isolation, they have the ability to mix together. The challenge is to simplify and edit what you see for clarily so that the movement and form of the figure have the primary read. 

Beyond the new information presented above, the exact same techniques will be used to interpret and show drapery on the figures: wrapping lines, "T" overlaps, pinch vs. stretch, crisp sharp lines vs. softer gradations, and so on. 

The first fold is called an end fold. The simple idea behind this fold is that when drapery ends, it always describes the perspective of whatever form it is conforming to. In other words, the end fold will always just fit to a wrapping line on whatever perspective it follows.

The second fold is called a cylinder fold. The cylinder fold is characterized by a consistent placement of tension points. This consistent placement of tension points results in the fabric looking as though there are a number cylinders lined up next to one another. Apart from the figure, you can see examples of this fold in a shower curtain, window curtains, or anywhere else where there is a consistent grab to the fabric. In addition to the fold or fabric as a static form, keep in mind that this fold can change shape through gesture, just like the anatomical shapes. This fold, as well as all the others, stretch or pinch based on how the figure pushes the tension points. 

The third fold is a "U" fold. Notice the "U" fold is caused by the drapery being suspended between two main tension points. Additionally, notice the squash and stretch of the fold is still designed with "C" and "S" curves. This fold can potentially appear between tension points (landmarks) that have fabric suspended between them. 

The fourth fold is called a pinch fold. A pinch fold can take place between any two tension points in close enough proximity to pinch fabric between them for example, the bend of the arm or leg, between the neck and shoulder, the rib cage against the pelvis, etc.

The fifth fold is called a "S" or spiral fold. The "S" fold represents two tension points twisting the fabric in opposing directions. This could take place on the arm, or, in the case of longer draping clothing, from head to fool (in the case of a twist of the whole body). Notice that the main design of the fold is first described as the "S" connecting two points, then wrapping across the two volumes, and ending behind the forms in a "T" overlap. 

The sixth fold is the "Z" fold. The "Z" fold is based off the letter to help remember the asymmetrical compression of clothing as a result of gravity and excess fabric. This fold is most likely seen at the bottom of the pants/leg. In this particular example, remember that you also want to combine the "Z" fold with the end fold to describe the compression of fabric that ends with the perspective of the form it is on.
