In addition to being familiar with the hand's skeletal structure, understanding the anatomy of the hand will contribute to an understanding of gesture and volume. The anatomy shown below represents a simplified understanding of the major muscle groups shown in the hand. Remember, this is meant to aid in the development of a working process. An in-depth study of anatomy requires additional resources.
