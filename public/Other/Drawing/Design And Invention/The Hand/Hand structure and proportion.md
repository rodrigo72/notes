The hand is primarily made up of three groups of bones: the carpus group, the metacarpus (the bones of the palm), and the phalanges (the bones of the fingers).

The drawing below is a diagram of the bones in the hand. The circle shown near the top of the hand represents the carpus group. The carpus group is a collection of eight bones organized in a brige-like form.

The diagram below shows this bridge seen as if the fingers were pointing directly at you. The carpus group is carried through every stage of the hand drawing. This area, and shape shown below, are the design theme for the hand. Because the shape of the hand is dependent on this form for its effective use and function, you should integrate its effects into your depiction of the hand at every stage, from proportion to the design of perspectives.

Note that the wrapping line drawn over the carpus group (orange circle) suggests an apex or high point to the form. Because of the bridgelike quality of the carpus group, a vacancy is created beneath. This area is known as the carpal tunnel, and is occupied by tendons that branch out into the fingers.

The diagram bellow shows the proportional relationship between these groups. That oval is split at half-way point to represent the end of the metacarpals (knucles.
The upper half of the hand is made up of one-third carpus group and two thirds metacarpals. The lower half of the hand is made up entirely of the fingers/ phalanges.

The bones in the fingers are proportionally-based on a 3:2 ratio. The diagram above shows the relationship between the three bones in the finger: the proximal (closest to the palm), middle, and distal (furthest bone or tip of the finger) phalanx.

Note that the proximal phalanx as a whole (shown in orange) has been broken into three sections. Two of these sections are shown in blue. These two parts are the length of the next bone, the middle phalanx. The same approach is then applied to the middle phalanx: the overall length (shown in blue) is broken into three equal parts. Two of these three parts (shown in purple) are the length of the last bone in the fingrt, the distal phalanx.
