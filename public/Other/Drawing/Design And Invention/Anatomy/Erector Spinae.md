# Gesture

The erector spinae (or sacrospinalis) is a muscle group that extends the vertebral column and head, as well as aiding in flexion and rotation. This muscle group begins on the inner surface of the iliac crest and ends into numerous points on the back of all twelve ribs, and eventually into the skull.

# Shape

The erector spinae can be simplified into a shape that resembles two corn dogs side-by-side, or two ovoid shapes above two cylinders. Depending on the activity taken by the figure, these simple shapes can easily be shown to pinch (by contracting their shape) or stretch (by elongating the forms).

# Volume

The volume of the erector spinae should be shown following the perspective and volume of the spine, rib cage and pelvis.
