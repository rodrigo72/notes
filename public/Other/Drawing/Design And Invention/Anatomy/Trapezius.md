# Gesture

The trapezius rotates, lifts and pulls the scapula. Its origin is at the base of the scull and down to the twelve thoracic vertebrae. The trapezius inserts along the lateral third of the clavicle, the upper edge of the spine of the scapula, and ending at the tubercle of the spine.

# Shape

The trapezius can be more easily used and remembered by simplying it into a basic shape. The complex shape of the trapezius can be thought of as an upside-down dagger.

The top or handle of the dagger is the portion of the muscle inserting into the base of the skull. As the wings of the trapezius swing down the top of the scapula, the handles of the dagger can be seen. 
Where the muscle pulls in a point to the spine, the blade of the dagger can be seen.

The shape of the trapezius can also change to suggest a movement or activity. Notice how the shape of the trapezius pinches when the scapula moves closer to the spine. Conversly, when the scapula pulls forward with the movement of the arm, the trapezius is stretched and is shown as thinner, pulling across the ribs beneath.

Additionally, the shape of the trapezius (along with all the overall shape of every muscle can be altered to suggest gender, type, or character).

# Volume

The volume of the trapezius should be shown moving across the major forms it rests on - the head, neck, scapulae, and rib cage. 
Additionally, its volume will be affected when the muscle's shape is stretched or pinched.
