# Gesture

The external oblique attaches to the lower eight ribs of the rib cage, running downwards and to the back, inserting into the pelvis.

The function of this muscle is to bend the trunk laterally, to twist, and when both sides are used simultaneously the rib cage will be pulled down towards the pelvis.

# Shape

The shape of the obliques can be thought of as two elongated rectangels, similar to two colummns supporting the rib cage over the pelvis.

When drawing this shape, attach the obliques to a wrapping line lower down on the form of the rib cage, while relating them from the side to the back.

# Volume

When assigning volume to the obliques, make the shape wrap around the existing forms, but also think of this shape as having a depth similar to a flattened box.
