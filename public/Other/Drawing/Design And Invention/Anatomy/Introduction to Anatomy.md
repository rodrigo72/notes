The most important step in developing a drawing that includes anatomy is to first work through a process.
Working through gesture, shapes, landmarks, and then volume gives your drawings a sense of solidity that the anatomy will need to respond to.

The muscles pointed out in this section are only muscles seen or affecting the surface of the forms, i.e. this is a highly simplified approach to anatomy meant to serve as a foundation of a working process.

In understanding the muscles, the same approach to the figure is implemented: first, gesture and shape, then the development of volume and perspective.
