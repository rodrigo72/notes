# Gesture

The serratus slides the scapula forward and aids in elevating the shoulder and the arm. It originates on the outer surfaces of the first eight or nine ribs and inserts into the underslide of the scapula.

# Volume

The volume of the serratus should show the muscle as a sphere or ovoid form. Additionally, this muscle should appear to be a smaller form sitting on the larger form of the rib cage.

# Shape

The shape of the serratus can resemble an egg form with three legs or tabs coming out from the bottom. 
The top portion of the egg represents the muscle pulling under and to the bottom of the scapula, while the feet or tabs shows the muscle pulling into and between the ribs. Additionally, these feet can be shown connecting into the upper portion of the obliques in order to develop a strong connection between the anatomical shapes.
