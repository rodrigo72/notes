# Gesture

The pectoralis muscle pulls the arm forward across the chest and rotates the arms medially. 

Remeber the description of the muscle's action is what you want to look for when deciding the "C" or the "S" curve, which again is the basic gesture to the muscle. It begins on the medial half of the clavicle, along the length of the sternum, and across the cartilages of the first six or seven ribs, inserting into the bicipital groove onthe front of the humerus.

# Shape

The shape of the pectoralis resembles a fan, with the clavicular, sternocostal, and abnominal sections overlaping - or even more simply like a gold fish with its head missing. The flat portion of the missing head sits along the sternum, while the tail can be seen wrapping and pulling to the front of the humerus.

The pectoralis can simply be thought of as a small box or rectangle sitting on top of the rib cage. The width of the pectoralis should be shown towards the bottom of the form nearest the nipple. 

The volume will be displaced depending on the action. For example, if the arm is raised, the volume is spread more evenly and will have less of a noticeable corner. If the pectoralis is flexing or contracted, the volume becomes peaked and will have a more noticeable width.

# Volume

The shape will change when the arm raises by showing the tail of the goldfish unwrapping and becoming elongated.

Remember, this basic anatomical design can be changed to develop likeness, gender, animal, or creature.

For example, the shape of the pectoralis can be altered in order to portray the female by overlapping a sphere (for the breast) under then over the initial pectoralis design.
