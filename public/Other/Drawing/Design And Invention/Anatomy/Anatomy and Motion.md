The following studies/ diagrams describe activities of the body by designing the anatomical shapes with one simple rule (active/ passive or squash/ stretch).

>[!tip]
>"S" Curve = Stretch or passive anatomical shape
>"C" Curve = Pinch or active anatomical shape

Active shapes of anatomy will take the basic sesign of the shape and show it squashed or in a compressed stated. Extreme activity has more exaggerated compression, while a less extreme action may only have a slightly compressed appearence.

A non-active (passive) shape will be stretched or shown elongated. This active vs. passive demonstration of anatomy is incredibly important for keeping the believable asymmetrical quality to your drawings, as well as accurately describing the mechanincs of the body.
