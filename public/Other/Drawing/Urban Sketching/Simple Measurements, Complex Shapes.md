1. Break down the shapes with measurements. The head and the legs are actually the same height. This means the very tip of the beak is close to the center of the figure. Also, the whole height of the figure matches the height of the wing (line B). We can also see thast the width of the knees (line C) can be checked against the torso from the tip of the kilt to the center of the forehead. The width of the elbows can be compared to the height from fingernails to the ground under the feet.

2. Sketch the first few lines, starting to outline the figure (The pencil lines you see here are darkened for clarity). Start with a very light hand. Expect to have to erase a few things along the way. Set up the head and body to fit inside the line A measurements. For now, just mark where the tip of the wing goes with the Line B measure.

3. Move onto the left side to complete the silhoutte. Do some angle checks to test the slope of the limbs.
