The idea is to work larger-to-smaller, establishing the big shapes before investing time on the details. It's a very fast way to sketch. A lot of problems with these outside shapes can be solved by doing corrections when things are still simple outlines.

## Sight measuring and angle checking

1. Decide roughly how large you want the sketch on the page. Mark a small dash at the top and the bottom of your subject and lightly sketch a scribble of the outside shape. Don't add internal detail, just focus on the silhoutte, as if it was cut out of a piece of paper.

2. As you look at the subject, extend your arm straight (elbow locked), and line up the tip of your pencil with the top of the subject. Slide your thumb down until it’s lined up with the base. That position you’ve marked on your brush or pencil—that is a unit measure you can use to check against other objects. (Line A).Keep your thumb in position on the pencil to preserve the measurement you have marked. Keep your elbow locked to maintain the same distance from the subject. Don’t move your feet either. If you step back, the scale of everything will change. Look for something you can compare your measurement against. It so happens that the height of the jar is equal to the width across the three cups. (Line A = Line B). This gives us something we can check in our drawing. There won’t always be a perfect match. Sometimes you’ll have to estimate.

3. Now compare the height and width of the sketch—oops! The drawing is not correct. See how we have caught that error with this simple measuring trick. This is a pretty small error, which can be fixed by refining the sketch. Make the fix to the silhouette so that the jar height (A) matches the cup width (B). Sketch in the dividing line between the dark ceramic base and the upper patterned area. This is  what is meant by working larger-to-smaller. Once you have the outside shape, what is the next biggest thing you can draw? The waist of the bottle is the next-largest shape, dividing the jar in half.

4. The next kind of measurement is what I call an angle check. It’s is ideal for finding roof lines, or check-ing perspective on narrowing city streets. Measure the slope between two points. Place the base of the pencil on the first point, (the edge of the cup) holding the pencil vertically, then rotate the tip until it lines up with your second point (the lip of the jar). Now lock your wrist. Don’t move the angle of the pencil. Simply place it over your drawing and see how well the angle lines up with what you’ve drawn. It’s looking reasonably close after widening those cups.

5. The blue lines are the original scribble. See how far out it was at first? Now that you’ve confirmed the silhouette, you can kick back and have fun. By starting outside-in, you can see for certain that you have a shape you like before you get into those details. Freely scribble in the pattern. Don’t stiffen up while doing it. You wouldn’t feel as free if you weren’t sure about the underlying structure, and it wouldn’t turn out as loose and sketchy as you want. Oddly, it’s the measuring that allows the sketch to look spontaneous. Many artists use the saying, “Loose is how a drawing looks, not how it’s made.“
