- Take your suplies everywhere: 
For an entire month, don’t leave the house without taking along some simple drawing supplies

- Draw Constantly:
Start and keep the habit of drawing every time you feel the inclination. Draw in every stolen moment, using all of life’s little delays as bonus time. This is the best and easiest thing you can do to succeed as an urban sketcher.

- Go easy on yourself
This is the most important thing. Don’t  judge your sketches in any way. Every  
sketch is a good sketch. Just keep doing  them. You don’t even have to show any- one. Judge your progress only by how many pages you fill. The result doesn’t matter—only the act of drawing—the fact you put pen to paper and made a mark that day.

- Find Subjects All Around You
Indulge yourself by sketching anything that catches your fancy. If you’re a commuter, take out your sketchbook instead of your phone. If you work in an office, you can probably steal a few minutes to look out of a window and do a quick sketch. If you’re a smoker, well then, you have plenty of opportunity.  
If you watch TV or play video games, hit pause and sketch what you see on the screen.

- Fill A Sketchbook in a Month
If you can keep this state of mind of recording everything, treating it like a kind of diary, you can finish a small sketch-book in a month. After you fill your first book, congratulate yourself. Then immediately start another.
