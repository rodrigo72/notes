## Drawing the effect of detail, not the exact detail

- make it easy for people looking at a complex scene to know what's happening, what's going on -> make sure that a few of the objects are easy to see and easy to recognize (reasonably sized, without much room for confusion in them or around them -> hightlight the shape)
- silhouettes are important
- make it easy to attach meaning to
- dark shadows as a path for the eyes to follow
- further away -> lines are  thiner, softer and more gestural; darker on what's closer
- do not feel every gap equally, make it random
- what are the thing's that stand out? how and why?
- negative space (drawing the space between things)
