## Introduction

Such rapid change inevitably comes at a psychological cost, and this is what Sōseki acutely documented in his finest novels

Sōseki increasingly sought to portray for his readers not only the upheavals of their rapidly changing world but the dilemmas and suffering of the contemporary psyche.

## CHAPTER 4

> **I pity him now, for I realize that he was in fact sending a warning, to someone who was attempting to grow close to him, signaling that he was unworthy of such intimacy. For all his unresponsiveness to others’ affection, I now see, it was not them he despised but himself.**

## CHAPTER 14

“You mustn’t be so hot-headed,” Sensei warned me.“On the contrary, being coolheaded is what’s led me to draw these conclusions,” I replied confidently.Sensei would not accept that. “You’re being carried along by passion. Once the fever passes, you’ll feel disillusioned. All this admiration is distressing enough, heaven knows, but it’s even more painful to foresee the change that will take place in you sooner or later.”

## CHAPTER 16

“I don’t like argumentation. You men do it a lot, don’t you? You seem to enjoy it. I’m always amazed at how men can go on and on, happily passing around the empty cup of some futile discussion.

## CHAPTER 28

But do you imagine there’s a certain type of person in the world who conforms to the idea of a ‘bad person’? You’ll never find someone who fits that mold neatly, you know. On the whole, all people are good, or at least they’re normal. The frightening thing is that they can suddenly turn bad when it comes to the crunch. That’s why you have to be careful.”

## CHAPTER 32

 Lying there, I reviewed my past and imagined my future. This diploma stood like a boundary marker between the one and the other. It was a strange document indeed, I decided, both significant and meaningless.

## CHAPTER 33

“Well, it’s not really a question of how much, you know . . . I mean, we get by, one way and another . . . Anyway, that’s beside the point. The point is, you really must find something to do in life. You can’t just laze around like Sensei does . . .”Sensei turned slightly. “I don’t just laze around,” he protested.

## CHAPTER 36

I wrote those words simply as they occurred to me, but once they were out, I found myself feeling rather different.In the train I pondered these contradictions, and I soon began to see myself as superficial and emotionally irresponsible. 

## CHAPTER 37

“You must realize how it pleases me that this son of mine, whom I raised with such love and care, should graduate while I’m still alive and well to witness it. Having someone make such a fuss about a mere graduation must seem boring to you, with all your aspirations—I can see that. But stand in my shoes, and you’ll see it a bit differently. What I’m saying is, it’s a fine thing for me, if not for you, don’t you see?”

## CHAPTER 41

I would receive no reply. I was lonely. This was why I wrote letters: I hoped for a response.

## CHAPTER 43

Giving your children an education has its good and bad points, I must say. You go to the trouble of training them, and then they don’t come home again. It seems to me an education is the easy way to split up a family.

## CHAPTER 62

 But I believe that a commonplace idea stated with passionate conviction carries more living truth than some novel observation expressed with cool indifference.

## CHAPTER 66

At times I felt a suffocating pressure, as if I had swallowed lead. Yet at the same time every nerve was on edge.

## CHAPTER 79

I pointed out that if we two men were to go on talking exclusively to each other forever, we would simply continue in the same straight line

## CHAPTER 90

So my pain was now mixed with a kind of terror—the beginnings of a horrified recognition that he was stronger than I.

## CHAPTER 91

I knew how strong he was, and how intensely earnest. I was convinced that there was a lot more I needed to know before I could decide on my own attitude. On the other hand, the thought of having anything more to do with him was strangely repugnant.

## CHAPTER 106

> **I suddenly understood that I was no different from my uncle, and the knowledge made me reel. What could I do? Others were already repulsive to me, and now I was repulsive even to myself.**
