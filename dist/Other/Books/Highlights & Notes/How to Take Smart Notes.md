# Highlights

> Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work.

> The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic.

> It is not so important who you are, but what you do.

> Nobody needs willpower not to eat a chocolate bar when there isn't one around. And nobody needs willpower to do something they wanted to do anyway. Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long- and short-term interests. Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time. Not *having to use* willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success. This is where the organization of writing and note-taking comes into play.
> 
> "I never force myself to do anything I don't feel like. Whenever I am stuck, I do something else." A good structure allows you to do that, to move seamlessly from one task to another.

> If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and you start focusing on what is important.

> A good structure enables flow, the state in which you get so completly immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes effortless.

> Having a clear structure to work in is completely different from making plans about something. If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible. To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower. This is not only demotivating, but also unsuitable for an open-ended process like research, thinking or studying in general, where we have to adjust our next steps with every new insight, understanding or achievement.

> Studies on highly succesful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place.

> Assemble notes and bring them into order, turn these notes into a draft, review it and you are done.

> Writing these notes is also not the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is. And this is how it is supposed to be. The notes are just the tangible outcome of it.

> If there is one thing the experts agree on, then it is this: You have to externalise your ideas, you have to wrtite.

> Feedback loops are not only crucial to for the dynamics of motivation, but also the key element to any learning process. Nothing motivates us more than the experience of becoming better at what we do. And the only chance to improve in something is getting timely and concrete feedback.

> The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-opne, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame

> Verbatim notes can be taken with almost no thinking

> Reading, especially rereading, can easily fool us into believing we understand a text.

> What good readers can do is spot the limitations of a particular approach and see what what is not mentioned in the text.

> To be able to play with ideas, we first have to liberate them from their original context by means of abstraction and re-specification

> Without structure, we cannot differentiate, compare or experiment with ideas.

> "What is interesting about this?" and "What is so relevant about this that it is worth noting down.

> Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.

> When we perform an action repeatedly, its familiarity seems to bleed back into our judgments about that behavior. We end up feeling we have more control over precisely the behaviors that, in reality, we have least control over
