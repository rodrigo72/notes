# Gesture

The rectus abdominis (or abdominal group) works to flex the trunk at the lumbar vertebrae. This muscle group begins at the base of the public bone and inserts into the surfaces of the fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs.

# Shape

The abdominal group can be simplified into a shape resembling a bullet. The curved portion of the bullet fits into the pelvis, while the flattened end lies along the ribs above the thoracic arch.

Within this shape, there are eight sections. Starting from a straight or horizontal line around the area of the belly button, these sections progressively rise to a peak.

When the trunk moves front, back, or side to side, this shape can be shown pinching, stretching, or aiding in a twist.

# Volume

The volume of the abdominals should be shown with a very thin side plain. This gives the viewer an indication of the depth of this muscle group. Ultimately, this volume will resemble a flattened box or rectangle.
