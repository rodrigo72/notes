# Gesture

Adducts, extends, and rotates the humerus. Additionally, the latissimus pulls the arms down (like when swimming) or lifts the body up (as in climbing).

The latissimus originates along the lower sixth thoracic vertebrae and the crest of the ilium. It inserts on the front of the humerus higher than the attachment of the pectoralis.

# Shape

The shape of the latissimus resembles a bowl with arms and legs. The arms on the sides of the bowl are small triangles. The design of these arms suggests that the shape of the latissimus, like the pectoralis, unfolds when it is stretched.

# Volume

The latissimus can be given perspective and a feeling of volume by wrapping the top of the shape with the perspective of the bottom of the rib cage (from behind).
As the bottom of the latissimus ends on the pelvis, it should be drawn to sit on the perspective of the pelvis.
