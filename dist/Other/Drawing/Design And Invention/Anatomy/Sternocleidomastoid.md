# Gesture

The sternomastoid muscles work to **pull the head and neck forward as well as rotate and face laterally**. These muscles begin on the interior surface of the manubrium and clavicle and insert into the skull behind the ear.

# Shape

The sternomastoid can easily be remembered as a shape that resembles a baseball bat. When placing this shape, remember that it is aligned in a diagonal from the manubrium to the base of the skull.

Additionally, the shape of the sternamastoid should not be drawn symmetrically. One side of the shape is always higher, mimicking the design principles in our gesture.

When the head turns, the involvement of these muscles can be indicated by elongating their shapes (indicating a passive state or stretch) or by contracting and shortening the form (which will indicate an active state or the muscle being used).

# Volume

The volume of the sternomastoid should be shown wrapping around the cylinder of the neck while moving back spatially to suggest the distance from the manubrium back to the base of the skull.
