# Shape

Seen from the side, the shape of the deltoid resembles an upside-down triangle. From the front or back, the deltoid still appears as a triangle - just a much thinner one.

The above diagram represents a second perspective structure to describe the shoulder girdle. The shoulder girdle is the combination of the clavicle and scapula. This structure sits **on top of the rib cage** and acts as an incredibly useful tool for organizing/ understanding the shoulders.

# Volume

The most effective way to show the deltoid in perspective, with a strong sense of volume, is by wrapping its insertioin point in the same perspective as the direction of the arm.

The deltoid should also reflect the perspective of the upper body as its origin pulls away from the shoulder girdle.
