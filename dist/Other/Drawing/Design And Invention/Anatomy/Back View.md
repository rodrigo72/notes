It is important to keep in mind the overall process at this point.
Remember the progression: Gesture, Shapes, Landmarks/ Volume, Anatomy, Value.

Think of these as all being related. Any time you move to another step, that step still needs to address all that came before it. For example, when we start to develop anatomy, we have to address the three steps that came before it in order to stay true to the original intention or gesture. Additionaly, remember that drawing the pecs or deltoid is the description of a smaller or micro-gesture that is a smaller argument in support of the larger area (the initial gesture).
