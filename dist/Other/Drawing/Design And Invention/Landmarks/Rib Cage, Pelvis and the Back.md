The skeleton can be used to look at the figure symmetrically. In a full-frontal or back view, a line down the center of the skeleton splits the figure into two equal halves. **Landmarks** give us this line of symmetry.

All of the following landmarks are areas of bone that visibly push through the flesh. For the time being, we are concerned with the landmarks of the rib cage and  pelvis. Keep in mind that these are simplified designs based on knowledge of the skeleton.

Examples B, C, and D show the positions of the landmarks as the figure starts to move through space. Notice that the line of symmetry on the three-quarter, side, and three-quarter back has remained, but now begins to favor, or move closer to, one side of the figure.
Where the line of symmetry had previously divided the figure into two equal parts, now it helps to align the shape of the landmarks and show a turn. As the flat view becomes a slightly angled view, the rib cage and pelvis are shown with an interior corner. This interior corner will be used to show the perspective by allowing the rib cage and pelvis to be turned into a box.

>[!Tip]
>The line of symmetry will always be a "C" curve when the rib cage and pelvis are facing the same direction. When the rib cage and pelvis are twisting, the line of symmetry will always be an "S" curve.
