# The finger

The diagram below shows how to put all of this information into a manageable process.

The first step shows the placement of the knuckles and bones only using the spheres and straights. This first step focuses on placement and proportion. 

The second step builds upon the first by assigning each finger a perspective using the cylinder and the “T” overlaps. 

The last step focuses on designing the finger, building on the previous steps. The underside of the finger has been drawn only using "C" curves. A "C" is drawn from the back of one sphere to the center of the next (this curve changes depending on whether or not the finger is pinched). Study the drawing below to see how all of the stages have been used to reach a well-constructed, informed drawing.

# The Hand

The hand is always placed first using the "S" curves to describe the width of the radius and the ulna and the movement into the middle three fingers. A "S" or "C" can be used to start depending on how the hand is moving in relation to the wrist.

In the second step, a "C" curve is used to place where the fingers end. It is important to use a curve at this stage to begin developing the shape of the carpus group. Because the hand is based off of the carpus group, everything relates using curves. The fingertips and knuckles will always line up on a curve or arc. The curve used in this step shows this important element while creating a glove-like shape that places the overall position of the hand.
