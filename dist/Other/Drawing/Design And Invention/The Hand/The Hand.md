When drawing the hand, you will follow a similar process to the one used when drawing at the head, and this same process will again be used again when looking at the foot in a future chapter. 

To review, you will begin by looking at the skeleton, proportion, and anatomy, in order to develop designs that can be effective in the process of drawing. Next, take those informed designs and render them with variations of the box, cylinder, and sphere in order to create a believable effect of space. Finally, you should create contours that can be worked over the forms to present a more organic description.
