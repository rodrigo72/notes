This step begins with finding the hairline and drawing it in perspective all the way around to the back of the skull. 

Next, beginning **from the base of the nose**, draw another line back across the form to the back of the skull. 

Between the back of the skull, the top of the line drawn from the hairline, the outside of the brow, and the line drawn from the base of the nose, draw an ellipse to represent the side plane of the skull. These four points are always used to find this side plane; however, the orientation and the size of the ellipse will change depending on the perspective. 

This is the most important stage in giving the head a 3-D appearance. In a very simple way, the box (top right of the illustration) describes what is beginning to take place on the skull. 

**Between the four points mentioned above, draw two straight lines connecting them. One should be horizontal going from the back of the skull to the end of the brow, the other should be drawn from the line at the base of the nose to the top line at the hairline. During this step, keep the vertical line as close to matching the line of the tilt (step 2) as possible.**
