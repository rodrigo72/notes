This step begins by placing the ear. The ear sits in the lower quarter, created by drawing the horizontal and vertical divisions in step 6. As shown in dark blue, the ear should be kept as a simple "C" shape that is **no taller than the base of the nose to the line of the brow**.

The second part of this step is to find the line of the cheek. As shown in dark blue, the line of the cheekbone begins at the top of the ear and continues as a "C" curve down to the corner of the jaw. The inclusion of the cheekbone adds another corner showing the front plane of the face, and now side plane for the jaw.
