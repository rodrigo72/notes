# Step 1 - The Sphere

The sphere represents the cranial mass, which is 2/3 of the entire skull.

When drawing the head, continue to use the same process outlined in the first two chapters. Begin with broad 2D ideias of position, orientation, and placement, **then** build into perspective, and finally construct the details on top of those developed surfaces. 

# Step 2 - The Tilt

# Step 3 - Adding the Jaw

This step introduces the shape of the jaw back onto the cranial mass.

![[drawing_34.png]]

The shapeof the jaw is formed by extending the lines of the cranial mass down to give the skull an overall egg shape.

The areas in these diagrams show the shape of the jaw from a front, three-quarter, and a profile view. Observe how, with only shapes, the placement of the jaw starts to suggest a 3D look or position in space.

>[!Tip]
>The addition of the jaw will represent the remaining 1/3 of the skull, unless otherwise changed for exaggeration in character, animal or creature.

At this stage, you should be focused on using the jaw, indicated with a straight, horizontal line for the chin, to show a complete turn. This involves an awareness of the symmetrical view, and what happens to the chin-line as the head turns right or left (shown in orange).
