This step begins by finding the recessive plane for the eye sockets (shown with orange dots). It is important to show that the plane for the sockets pushes into the skull at an angle. Also note that all four dots are connected to show one plane that begins at the brow line and ends at the proportion line for the bottom of the sockets. This plane does not go past the cut-out for the side plane of the head.

From the tip of the nose, at either end, two lines are drawn down to connect it to the base. You should now have one plane, which represents the bottom plane of the nose. The next step (above right) is to draw two straight lines from the tip of the nose (pink dots) to the ends of the keystone shape above (orange dots). This form gives you the front plane for the bridge of the nose. 

To complete this structure, drop a line from the point at the keystone (orange dots) to the line for the bottom of the sockets (green dot) at about the same angle as was used for the side of the base of the nose. After connecting this again to the base of the nose (connect green dot to pink), you have the side plane of the nose drawn to proportion, accurately placed on a believable perspective-based form.
