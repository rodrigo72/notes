In order to keep this natural quality of the human form a constant in our drawings, we need a use of line that continually emphasizes visual ideas of balance and movement.

Beginning with only a "C" or "S" curve, the main focus is on positioning one of the curve's apexes higher that the one that follows
By keeping the high points of the curves slightly offset, the eye is forced to move through them. This gives you the ability to have a great deal of control over where the viewer's eye goes and how quickly.

Avoid line use, which, instead of playing the curves off one another, uses mirroring or parallels. This approach closes off the form visually and does not allow for a flow between forms.

>[!Tip]
> In order to keep the two examples separte, try remembering that the asymmetrical lines give the viewer's eye a pinballlike experience - always bouncing the attention to a line into another direction. The symmetrical curves stiffen that experience into a snowmanshaped appearance - generally, we don't associate snowmen with a great deal of excited movement.
