When developing a gesture drawing, it is important to be aware that you are describing the eight parts of the body.
The eight parts include:

- Head
- Spine
- Arms (2)
- Pelvis
- Rib Cage
- Legs (2)

The essential elements you will describe using these eight parts include a sense of story and composition. Giving the pose a "sense of story" means communicating a unique sense of positioning or attitude. 
Every person has a specific way of holding himself or herself when moving. By exaggerating the "story," you give your viewer a compelling image to experience.
When creating a gesture drawing, this envolves developing your figure's proportions and giving your figure a sense of balance and weight.

The lines most crucial to showing a figure are the "C" curve, the straight line, and "S" curve. In this drawing process, you will never use any other type of line.

>[!Tip]
>When checking the proportion of the figure, try to avoid doing any slow, methodical measuring. Instead, base the proportions off what looks correct after establishing the figure from head to foot. If it looks incorrect, change it - the drawing is still at an early stage where correction is easy. The downside to slowly measuring out the figure is that it stiffens the poses. Focus on the activity - the proportion can be corrected later.
