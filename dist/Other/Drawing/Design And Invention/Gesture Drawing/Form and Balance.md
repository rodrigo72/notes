The most important thing to keep in mind while drawing the figure is that the human form is essentially a balancing act.

In the side view, the head is suspended out over the rib cage by the forward angle of the neck. The neck and head are in turn balanced by the rib cage as it pushes at the opposite angle.

The pelvis moves opposite to the tilt of the rib cage, and the legs stabilize the body in the shape of a large "S".

The side view shows us that the skeleton is designed in a way that naturally balances the figure.
