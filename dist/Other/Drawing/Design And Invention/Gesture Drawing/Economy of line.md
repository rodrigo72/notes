# Creating a Story 

“Creating a sense of story” in your gesture drawings can mean a number of different things. Gesture can be the way we recognize moods through body mechanics, the innate ability to recognize your best friend from 20-30 feet away, or just simply being able to read the body as a type of communication. When studying gesture drawings, it will be a common exercise to exaggerate these positions until you become more comfortable with articulating a wide range of expressions. Once the ability to develop the exaggerated is achieved, the more natural subtleties of expression will be much easier to create.

**The reason all of our design elements are focused on asymmetry, balance, movement, etc. is essentially because we are describing a machine moving through a series of controlled falls.**

> Remember that at no point in a gesture drawing should you be worried about developing a likeness, or drawing contour lines. Focus on the movement caused by the line use - think of these drawings as being abstract exercises in **using line to move the eye.**

> FIgure drawing is not so much about making something that looks like a person, but instead developing incredibly complex artistic practices and skills. Learning these skills will allow you to easily create any variety of figure or character desired.
