There are hundreds of different configurations for the creation of a pose, and each one is governed by the desired effect and context of a given story. The following exercise will help you create a sense of impending action, and is an exercise I generally give to students who are stuck making stiff symmetrical positions. While this exercise isn't the solution to how every pose should be thought through, it is one tool to use when thinking about the mechanics of the figure, and how these mechanics can be used.

Stiff, symmetrical poses, while good for suggestion of power, strength and/or immobility, often lack a sense of lyricism and exaggeration. In an effort to push towards these more dynamic attributes in a pose, I ask my students to strive to create an "about to..." *quality*, which is a pose or position in their drawing that is **somewhere in mid-action, mid-step**, etc.

Stable, symmetrical ositions kee the action in stasis; the action has either not begun, or it has ended. An "about to..." position engages viewers by making them anticipate the outcome of the action, hopefully wanting to fill in the rest of the story.

The difference between a stable pose and one in mid-action is determined by how weight is distributed and balanced. WHile this approach can be used to analyze most positions, here it is demonstrated with the standing figure.

Keeping in mind the prior notes on the [[Center of Gravity]], build a triangle between the feet and either the belly button or nose. In poses that are very stable, the triangle mostly appears very stable at the bottom. 
Notice that in exaggerated positions, or out of balance poses, the triangle looks more irregular.
