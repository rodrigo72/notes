## Create Bold Shadow Shapes

For the purpose of training the eye, we will over-emphasize contrast in this sketch, creating bold, intensely dark shadow shapes. If you’re a beginner, it’s best to take as many sketches as possible up to step 2 while on location. Then you can choose a few favorites and refine the shading at home or over coffee in the museum cafe.
