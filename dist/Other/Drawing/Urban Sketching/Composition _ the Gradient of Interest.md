All of the elements that attract the eye, the highest detail and greatest contrast, should be combined at the compositional focal point and fade away smoothly towards the edges. Whatever aspect of the sketch is most important to you needs the greatest intensity of these three factors: placement, contrast and detail.  

In a larger drawing there may be secondary or tertiary areas of interest, which lead the viewer like a trail of bread crumbs. But none should be powerful enough to compete with the gravity of the focal point.
