Three-pass sketching is the ideal method for drawing real places and actual events as you expirience them. Of course, there are as many ways to draw as there are artists. But this systematic approach is the best balance I have found between accuracy, spontaneity and speed.

Every artist who is attracted to sketching will say they love the freedom of drawing swiftly and expressively, the pure joy of a lightning-fast sketch. At the same time, it is a common regret that the final result doesnâ€™t always look enough like the subject.

# First Pass: Contour Sketch

I often call the graphite under drawing the *scribble*, or *the capture* (when referring to drawing people or animals). The goal here is to make a loose, sketchy contour drawing working from outside in. You can also make note of interesting details for later use.

# Second Pass: Calligraphic Line Drawing

Once you have a satisfatory scribble, you can concetrate on making a beautiful ink drawing on top of it. This is a wonderfully freeing stage, as you're not thinking anymore. The work is done, and play begins. Just get into a zone making beautiful pen marks.

# Third Pass: Spot Blacks

In the third stage of this sketching method, use a brush and ink or a brush pen to place solid black brush marks into the shadow shapes. (If you find drawing with liquid ink to be awkward at first, just stick with a brush pen for a while. It gets easier after a few hours of practice.)
Well placed spot blacks instantly create visual focus.
Recall how you stablished a gradient of interest in the still life sketches by choosing which objects would get both constrast and detail. With spot blacks, you are doing the same thing but with much greater power.
