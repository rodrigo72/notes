This exercise will help re-enforce the idea of the scribble as information gathering and analysis, as opposed to the calligraphic line as the artistic expression. You never want the ink line to feel like busy work. It shouldn't be a chore to refine in ink on top of your scribble. Never approach it like you've already drawn the thing and now you're in autopilot. To that end, practice making the most with the least by doing a completely minimal scribble.
